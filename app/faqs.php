                                <p>The quickest way to receive a confirmation is to check the email box, but you may also provide a self-addressed, stamped envelope. Because we are a non-profit organization, SERA does not have a budget to cover mailing costs to fill requests mail back reservations to our travelers.</p>

                                <p>SERA reservations accepted by mail go to a post office box. This box is checked by SERA volunteers and then reservations are routed to the SERA representative responsible for the trip. This process can take some time and we appreciate your patience.</p>

                                <p>SERA is a non-profit organization. Trip costs are based on the actual cost of travel. We wait to deposit your reservation until we have generated enough interest in a trip to ensure SERA does not incur a loss if there is not enough interest in a trip. This will help alleviate having to issue refunds down the road if a trip is cancelled.</p>

                                <p>It is VERY important to be prompt. If you think you may be delayed, please contact the SERA representative – contact information can be found in your trip confirmation. SERA representatives may delay departure time no more than 15 minutes depending on extenuating circumstances such as weather conditions, if the bus is at risk of getting a ticket, etc. In New York City, it is often difficult to wait too long because bus companies will be at risk of being ticketed.</p>
